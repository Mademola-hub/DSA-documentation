# :brain: DSA-documentation SQL analysis 
This is my first project when I started learning data Analysis, with the incubator hub 

## Project Topic :  üè¨ Kultra Mega Stores Inventory Analysis

### üìÅ Project Overview
This report summarizes key insights extracted from data exported from the SQL Server. The data includes multiple analyses covering product sales, customer behavior, shipping costs, regional performance, and discount impact.The aim is to identify revenue drivers, understand customer segments, and uncover opportunities for cost optimization and targeted marketing.

### üßæ Data Source
The primary data sources used here is the KMS Sql Case Study.csv and this was given as aproject data provided by the organizer of the Data skill up Africa, which is the **INCUBATOR HUB** and this was provided through the canvas learning platform.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **SQL** [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
   (Structured Query Language) ‚Äì Used for all data extraction, transformation, and analysis steps.

# üîç Methodology

## 1. Database Setup
- **Database Creation**
  The projects started by creating a database called or named project_analysis.
  
- **Data inportaton and extraction** 
The raw data which was stored in a csv format was imported into the SQL server to create a table and to allow for visualization.

- **Data Cleaning**  
  Unnecessary columns were removed, and missing values were checked. Categorical values 
  were standardized.

  ```sql
  --- SQL project_analysis
  --- create databse
  Create database project_analysis;
  ```

--- Table manipulation , cleaning and alteration

```sql
alter table [KMS Sql Case Study]
alter column sales decimal ( 10, 2 );

alter table [KMS Sql Case Study]
alter column Discount decimal ( 10 , 2 );

alter table [KMS Sql Case Study]
alter column unit_price decimal ( 10 , 2 );

alter table [KMS Sql Case Study]
alter column profit decimal ( 10 , 2 );

alter table [KMS Sql Case Study]
alter column shipping_cost decimal ( 10 , 2 );

alter table [KMS Sql Case Study]
alter column product_base_margin decimal ( 10 , 2 );
```

### Advising the management on how to stimulate growth

**To increase revenue from KMS's bottom 10 customers, management should focus on understanding each customer's specific needs and behavior.**

**Key strategies include:**

- Personalized Engagement: Offer customized discounts, product recommendations (upselling and cross-selling), and educational content based on their past purchases and likely needs.

- Proactive Relationship Building: Reach out to them, gather feedback (surveys), and provide exceptional customer service to build trust and address any pain points.

- Incentivization: Implement loyalty programs, time-limited promotions, and referral programs to encourage repeat business and higher spending.

- Product Optimization: Analyze if there are product gaps or opportunities to create attractive bundles that offer more value.

By implementing these targeted approaches, KMS can convert these lower-spending customers into more valuable assets.

## üöö Shipping Cost Analysis

### ‚ùì Are KMS‚Äôs Shipping Methods Cost-Effective?

**Short Answer: No.**

There‚Äôs a clear disconnect between how KMS describes its shipping methods and what the data actually shows.


### üì¶ What KMS Says:
- **Delivery Truck** = Cheapest, but slowest  
- **Express Air** = Fastest, but most expensive


### üîç What the Data Shows:
- **Delivery Truck** is actually the **most expensive option**, with average costs ranging from **$43 to $47** across all order priorities.
- **Express Air**, expected to be costliest, is consistently **much cheaper**, averaging only **$6 to $8**.
- **Regular Air** is often the **cheapest option overall**, staying around **$7 to $8**.


### üí° Implications:
- KMS may be **wasting money** by using costly Delivery Trucks for regular or critical shipments.
- There may be **data issues**, **hidden logistics costs**, or poor **shipping**

## üîé Detailed Business Insights

### üíº Revenue Growth Opportunity
- The **bottom 10 customers** (e.g., *Jeremy Farry*, *Natalie DeCherney*) present an immediate opportunity for growth through targeted **retention and engagement strategies**.


### üë• Segment Performance
- **Corporate** and **Small Business** segments contain high-value customers like:
  - *Adam Hart* ‚Äì 27 orders
  - *Dennis Kane* ‚Äì over $75K in sales
- **Consumer segment** can also be profitable:
  - *Emily Phan* ‚Äì over $34K in profit

### üì¶ Product Category Strengths & Weaknesses
- **Top Categories**:  
  - *Technology* and *Furniture* drive significant revenue
- **Lagging Category**:
  - *Office Supplies* underperform ‚Äî may need a new marketing or pricing approach
- **High-Profit Products**:
  - *Polycom ViewStation*, *HP Laserjet Copier*
- **Unprofitable Items**:
  - Some products are sold **at a loss**, which signals an urgent need to review:
    - Pricing strategy  
    - Cost of goods  
    - Possible discontinuation

### üåç Regional Performance
- **Strongest Regions**:
  - *West* region leads in overall sales
  - *Ontario* performs strongly, especially in *Appliances*
  - *Yukon* performs well among smaller territories
- **Weaker Regions**:
  - *Nunavut* and *Prairie* lag in performance ‚Äî may indicate untapped potential or low market size

### üöö Shipping Cost Impact
- **Delivery Truck** is the **most expensive mode**, heavily impacting profit ‚Äî especially on lower-priced products
- **Regular Air** also has high total cost
- **Express Air** has **lower total cost**, possibly due to better efficiency or limited use
- üìå **Actionable Recommendation**:
  - Negotiate better shipping rates
  - Adjust pricing models to cover higher shipping costs
  - Encourage more cost-effective shipping choices at checkout

### üìå Summary
KMS demonstrates clear **strengths** in:
- Product categories (*Technology, Furniture*)
- High-value customers in all segments
- Top-performing regions like *West* and *Ontario*

But must address **gaps** in:
- Low-engagement customers
- Underperforming products and regions
- Expensive logistics (especially Delivery Truck)

By optimizing these areas, **Kultra Mega Stores** can boost profitability, customer retention, and overall operational efficiency.
